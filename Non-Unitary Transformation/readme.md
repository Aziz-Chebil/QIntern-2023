### Creating unitary gates out of non-unitary matrices

#### First approach ( intuitive ):
-Taking a matrix that has the following form, We can turn it to a quantum gate ( a b b a ) where a + b = 1  
-We calculate the eigenvectors of the matrix, in general they will be either ( 1, 1) and (-1,1) or (1,1) and (1,-1)  
-We create a new matrix U by combining the two eigenvectors together multiplied by a factor of normalization 1/sqrt(2)  
-We get the following unitary gate ( 1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) ) or ( -1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) )  

### Second approach :
Stinespring Dilation theorem  

### Third approach :
Kaus Representation
