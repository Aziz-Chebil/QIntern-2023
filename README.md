*Description:* The project aims to leverage quantum computing platforms to gain a deeper understanding of gene regulation and mutation. By harnessing the computational power of quantum systems, we seek to explore the complex dynamics of gene regulatory networks and unravel the intricacies of genetic mutations. Through quantum simulations and analysis, we aim to uncover novel insights into the mechanisms underlying gene regulation and its disruption due to mutations. This interdisciplinary approach, merging quantum computing and genetics, holds great potential for advancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes and contributing to the development of precision medicine and personalized treatments.
